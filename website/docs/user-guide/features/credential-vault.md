# Passwords & Logins

Say **"log into GitHub"** and the agent signs in for you. The first time it
reaches a sign-in page it has no login for, it asks you, right there, in a
masked prompt. After that it just works. Passwords are encrypted on this
machine and injected straight into the page; the model never sees them.

There is nothing to set up.

## What it looks like

**CLI / TUI**

```
🔐 Save login for github.com
   The agent reached a sign-in page with no saved login for this site.
   Type the email / username you sign in with (shown), then Enter.
   ...
   Now the password (hidden). It is encrypted on this machine, bound to
   https://github.com, and filled into the page without the model ever seeing it.
```

**Desktop** — a "Save your github.com login?" card with an identifier field and
a masked password field. *Save & sign in* stores it and continues; *Don't save*
tells the agent to stop asking for this turn.

From then on the agent lists your saved logins, types the identifier itself and
fills the password through Hermes. The tool result it sees is
`{filled_fields: 1, origin: "https://github.com"}`; the password is also
registered with the redactor so a later page read cannot echo it back.

## Two-factor codes

Sites that ask for a code after the password are handled the same way:

- **Authenticator key saved with the login** (the "setup key" or `otpauth://`
  link a site shows when you enable 2FA; 1Password and Bitwarden items that
  hold a TOTP seed count too): Hermes generates the current code and enters
  it. Nobody is asked. Add the key in **Settings → Passwords & Logins → Add**
  or `hermes vault add`; the item shows a *2FA auto* badge.
- **Code sent to your phone or email**: a small prompt appears in your
  surface ("Verification code for github.com"), you type the code, Hermes
  enters it into the page. The code never enters the conversation either.
- **Passkeys, hardware keys, app approvals** ("tap Approve in Duo"): nothing
  to type. The agent tells you to complete it on your device and waits for
  the page to move on.

## Already using 1Password or Bitwarden?

Nothing to enable. If the `op` or `bw` command-line tool is installed and signed
in, Hermes picks it up automatically and its website logins become fillable
alongside the local ones. The first time the agent needs one of those logins it
asks you to unlock the manager with your master password (masked prompt; once
per session, 30 minutes idle). Hermes hands the master password to the manager's
CLI through its non-interactive channel (`op signin` on stdin, `bw unlock
--passwordenv` in the child's environment) and keeps only the session token in
memory. The agent never sees the master password, the token, or any login.
A manager item that lists several websites (say `amazon.co.uk`,
`www.amazon.co.uk` and `eu.account.amazon.com`) fills on each of those exact
origins; nothing is inferred beyond the URLs saved on the item.

Prefer not to use a detected manager? `hermes vault sources --disable bitwarden`,
or the switch in **Settings → Passwords & Logins**.

## Paying and filling addresses

Local cards and addresses are saved once (**Settings → Passwords & Logins →
Add**, or `hermes vault add`) and remain bound to their saved checkout origin.
1Password Credit Card items are also listed as vault-qualified payment handles.
They can be used on a chosen HTTPS merchant after a fresh human confirmation;
there is no need to add merchant URLs or a global tag to the card.

**Every card fill asks you first.** The prompt names the merchant and the
document receiving the card, and expires after 120 seconds. Declining or a
changed document/field set refuses the fill. To select one exact open tab,
the agent uses `browser_vault_fill(handle, merchant_origin="https://shop.example")`.
The native path resolves values internally and supports all card fields in
one document: the merchant itself, or a Stripe (`https://js.stripe.com`) iframe,
including an out-of-process iframe. Separate number/expiry/CVC documents,
ambiguous controls, unapproved hosted origins and missing card fields are refused.
No sequential split-frame fallback exists.

HTTPS, ancestry and field identity checks are **not a seller reputation check**.
Verify the seller and payment terms independently before approving. The selected
document and its scripts receive the card as they would with manual entry. The
fill is pinned to that document and its actual element references; it is not an
atomic transaction across the entire checkout or a guarantee against a malicious
merchant. A transport failure after ingress is uncertain: inspect and obtain
fresh consent rather than treating failure as proof of zero writes.

Filled controls are visually masked. Standard browser screenshot/PDF/recording
and desktop capture entry points are disabled for the current profile after card ingress; use redacted text
inspection. Arbitrary code/terminal execution is not a containment boundary
(see `SECURITY.md`). Headless sessions cannot confirm and are refused. The native
tool never clicks submit; address fills need no confirmation.

## Managing what's saved

- **Desktop → Settings → Passwords & Logins**: everything saved, the detected
  password managers with Unlock/Lock, Add, Remove.
- **CLI**: `hermes vault list`, `hermes vault add`, `hermes vault rm <handle>`,
  `hermes vault sources`.

Items live encrypted under `~/.hermes/vault/` (Fernet key + vault file, both
`0600`), scoped to the profile. Labels, site origins and login identifiers are
visible metadata; passwords and card values never leave the vault except into
the page.

## Headless sessions

Cron jobs, webhooks, the API server and `hermes chat -q` have nobody to answer a
prompt. Saved local logins keep working there; a locked password manager reports
`unavailable_in_this_session` and a missing login reports `prompt_unavailable`.
Unlock or save from an interactive session first, or give 1Password a service
account token (`OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`).

```yaml
vault:
  onepassword:
    enabled: false          # opt OUT of a detected manager (default: on when installed)
    account: ""             # `op --account` shorthand; empty = default
    service_account_token_env: OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
  bitwarden:
    enabled: false
```

## What this does and does not guarantee

**Does:** the password never enters the model's context through Hermes: not in
tool results, logs, the session database, or the CLI arguments of any process.
Fills happen over the supervised browser session's direct CDP socket and are
refused unless the page origin exactly matches the saved origin, checked again
inside the page immediately before the write.

**Does not:** protect against the page itself. Once a password is typed into a
site, that site (and any script it runs) has it, exactly as when you type it
yourself. On a cloud browser backend the vendor's browser sees the page like any
other. The origin binding is the guard against filling on the wrong site, not
against a compromised right one.
